Abstract:
\begin{justify}
Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) holds immense potential for revolutionizing human-computer interaction by directly translating brain activity into actionable commands. In this project, we explore the application of BCI technology in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) through the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Leveraging the ZuCo dataset, we investigate the feasibility of decoding EEG signals into textual representations and further extend our analysis to sentiment classification tasks.

Our methodology involves the utilization of deep learning models to process EEG signals and extract meaningful features for downstream NLP tasks. We employ state-of-the-art pre-trained models for embeddings to enhance the representational power of our EEG data. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we assess the performance of various deep learning architectures in transforming EEG data into textual and sentiment-related information.

The results of our study demonstrate the potential of BCI technology in bridging the gap between neural signals and natural language, showcasing promising capabilities in tasks such as EEG-to-text translation and sentiment analysis. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research in BCI applications and highlight avenues for future exploration in the intersection of neuroscience and natural language processing.Your paragraph text here.

Our project "MINDSTREAM: Decoding Brain Signals into Text with NLP" explores the intriguing intersection of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) and natural language processing (NLP). While BCI technology has made remarkable strides in restoring motor functionalities for individuals with disabilities through motor imagery, decoding natural language directly from brain signals remains a formidable challenge. Previous approaches have encountered limitations in vocabulary size, device dependency, and articulation variability.This project extends the scope of BCI applications by transitioning from closed to open vocabulary EEG-to-text sequence-to-sequence decoding and zero-shot sentiment classification. Leveraging the ZuCo dataset and non-invasive EEG recordings, in this study we work on using deep learning models and pre-trained language embeddings to capture complex linguistic information from brain signals.

Inspired by recent advancements in large-scale pretrained language models such as BERT and GPT, the project explores the transfer learning capabilities of these models for EEG-to-text decoding. By fine-tuning pretrained language models and additional projection layers, the study aims to unlock contextualized representations of brain signals, encompassing syntactic and semantic features.

Moreover, the project underscores the importance of non-invasive EEG data due to its high temporal resolution and accessibility. While invasive devices like ECoG may offer superior performance, EEG provides a cost-effective and readily available alternative, crucial for training data-hungry models. Most importantly, this project aims at introducing novel tasks in open vocabulary EEG decoding and EEG-based sentiment classification taking inspirations from existing literatures and explores about how we are  marking towards a significant step forward in BCI-NLP integration. Integrating the  pretrained language models and non-invasive EEG data, we try to shed some light on the potential of BCI technology as a transformative tool for human-machine interaction in diverse domains.
